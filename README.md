# Online Timer

A countdown timer for personal use. Made while awaiting the return of Google's built-in timer that went down in summer 2022.

Features:
- Minimal UI
- Similar time entry to Google's timer tool; for example, you can enter both '90s' and '1m 30s'.
- Shows approximate remaining time in the tab title
- Might actually give you extra time :) (see note above)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
